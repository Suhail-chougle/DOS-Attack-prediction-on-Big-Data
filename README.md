## DOS Attack Prediction on Big Data

This project focuses on predicting DOS (Denial of Service) attacks on Big Data using exploratory data analysis and machine learning algorithms to bolster cybersecurity measures.

**Project Overview:**

The project encompasses the following key steps in data manipulation and analysis:

1. Data Preprocessing: The conventional data manipulation steps, such as handling missing values, feature engineering, and feature extraction, are employed to ensure data quality and relevance.

2. Data Visualization: The data is visualized to gain insights and better understand the patterns and trends within the dataset.

3. Addressing Class Imbalance: Class imbalances in the data are tackled to avoid biased predictions and enhance the accuracy of the analysis.

4. ML Pipeline Development: ML pipelines are created, encompassing essential stages such as string indexing, vector assembling, standard scaling, and user-defined functions to format the data optimally for machine learning algorithms.

**Machine Learning Algorithms Used:**

Three powerful machine-learning algorithms are applied to the processed data:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Gradient Boosting
3. Naive Bayes Classifier

**Evaluation Metrics:**

The performance of the models is assessed using multiple evaluation metrics, including:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

**Heatmap for Analysis:**

A heatmap is generated to visually present the distribution of false negatives and true positives, providing deeper insights into the model's performance.

**Detailed Comparison of Results:**

The study concludes with a comprehensive comparison of the results obtained from the different machine learning algorithms used. This allows for a deeper understanding of their respective strengths and weaknesses in predicting DOS attacks on Big Data.

Overall, this project aims to provide an effective approach to detecting and mitigating DOS attacks, contributing to improved cybersecurity for Big Data environments. The code and findings of the analysis will be made available on GitHub for further exploration and replication by the community.
